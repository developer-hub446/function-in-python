        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword. The basic syntax for defining a function is as follows:\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
        "    \"\"\"Docstring: Optional documentation for the function.\"\"\"\n",
        "    # Code block to be executed when the function is called\n",

        "*def keyword: Initiates the function definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "*function_name: A unique identifier for the function, following Python's naming conventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "*() (parentheses): Enclose any parameters the function accepts. If no parameters are needed, empty parentheses are still required.\n",
        "\n",
        "*: (colon): Marks the end of the function header.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Indented code block: Contains the statements that make up the function's logic. This block must be consistently indented.\n",
        "\n",
        "*return statement (optional): Used to send a value back to the caller. If omitted or used without an argument, the function implicitly returns None.\n",
        "Calling a Function in Python\n",
        "To execute the code within a defined function, you \"call\" it. This is done by writing the function's name followed by parentheses, enclosing any necessary arguments.\n",
        "Python\n",
        "*function_name(argument1, argument2, ...)\n",
        "function_name: The name of the function you wish to call.\n",
        "\n",
        "*() (parentheses): Enclose the arguments (actual values) that correspond to the parameters defined in the function. The number and type of arguments should match the function's parameter signature.\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    \"\"\"This function greets the given name.\"\"\"\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",

        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "->The return statement in a Python function serves two primary purposes:\n",
        "To exit the function:\n",
        "\n",
        "* When a return statement is encountered within a function, the execution of that function immediately terminates. Control is then passed back to the point in the code where the function was called.\n",
        "\n",
        "* To send a value back to the caller:\n",
        "The return statement can optionally be followed by a value or an expression. This value is then \"returned\" to the calling code, effectively becoming the result of the function call. This returned value can be assigned to a variable, used in an expression, or passed as an argument to another function. If no value is specified after return, or if the return statement is omitted entirely, the function implicitly returns None.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example -\n",
        "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
        "    sum_result = a + b\n",
        "    return sum_result # Returns the calculated sum\n",
        "\n",
        "result = add_numbers(5, 3)\n",
        "print(result) # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Python, iterators and iterables are fundamental concepts for working with sequences of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* An iterable is an object that can be iterated over, meaning it can return its members one at a time. Examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. An object is considered iterable if it implements either the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator, or the __getitem__() method, which allows access to elements by index.\n",
        "\n",
        "*An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It is responsible for producing the next value in a sequence when requested and maintaining the internal state of the iteration. An iterator must implement two methods:\n",
        "__iter__(): This method returns the iterator object itself.\n",
        "__next__(): This method returns the next item from the iterator. If there are no more items, it raises a StopIteration exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40] # This is an iterable\n",
        "\n",
        "my_iterator = iter(my_list) # This is an iterator\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 10\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 20\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 30\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 40\n",
        "# this ia an iterable\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Generators in Python are a special type of iterable that produce values lazily, one at a time, rather than storing all values in memory simultaneously. This makes them highly memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets or potentially infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "* How Generators are Defined:\n",
        "Generators are defined in Python primarily through two mechanisms:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Generator Functions: These are functions that contain one or more yield statements. When a generator function is called, it does not execute the function body immediately; instead, it returns a generator object. Each time the next() method is called on this generator object (either explicitly or implicitly during iteration, e.g., in a for loop), the function's execution resumes from where it last yielded a value. It continues until it encounters another yield statement, at which point it pauses and returns the yielded value. When the function completes or encounters a return statement (without a value), a StopIteration exception is raised, signaling the end of the sequence.\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    def count_up_to(n):\n",
        "        i = 0\n",
        "        while i < n:\n",
        "            yield i  # Yields a value and pauses execution\n",
        "            i += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Using the generator function\n",
        "    my_generator = count_up_to(5)\n",
        "    for num in my_generator:\n",
        "        print(num)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The advantages of using generators over regular functions include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "Generators produce values one at a time using the yield keyword, rather than computing and storing an entire sequence in memory like a regular function might when returning a list. This makes them highly efficient for handling large datasets or infinite sequences, as they only store the current state of iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Lazy Evaluation:\n",
        "Values are generated on demand, only when requested by the caller. This \"lazy\" approach saves processing time and CPU cycles, as computations are performed only when necessary, avoiding the upfront cost of generating all values at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Handling Infinite Sequences:\n",
        "Generators can naturally represent and iterate over infinite sequences, such as the Fibonacci sequence, without memory exhaustion, as they only generate the next element when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with def, lambda functions do not have a name and are restricted to a single expression. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression, which is implicitly returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example -\n",
        "\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "\n",
        "Typical Use Cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Lambda functions are typically used in situations where a small, one-time function is required, often as an argument to higher-order functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* With map(), filter(), and sorted(): Lambda functions are frequently used with these built-in functions to apply a specific operation or filtering logic to iterables without defining a separate, full function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The map() function in Python is a built-in higher-order function used to apply a specified function to each item in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set) and return an iterator containing the results. Its primary purpose is to efficiently transform or process elements within a collection without the need for explicit loops, promoting a more functional programming style.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Transformation:\n",
        "map() is designed to transform each element of an iterable by applying a given function to it. This is useful for operations like converting data types, performing mathematical calculations, or modifying string formats across an entire collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Efficiency:\n",
        "For large datasets, map() can be more efficient than explicit for loops, particularly when combined with other functional tools, as it returns an iterator, which can be memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage:\n",
        "The syntax for map() is straightforward:\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
        "function:\n",
        "This is the function that will be applied to each item of the iterable(s). It can be a named function or an anonymous lambda function.\n",
        "iterable:\n",
        "This is the sequence (list, tuple, set, etc.) whose elements will be passed to the function. Multiple iterables can be provided if the function accepts multiple arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Key Differences :\n",
        "\n",
        "* Output Type:\n",
        "map() and filter() return iterators (which can be converted to lists, tuples, etc.), while reduce() returns a single value.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Transformation vs. Selection vs. Aggregation:\n",
        "map() transforms elements, filter() selects elements based on a condition, and reduce() aggregates elements into a single result.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Function Signature:\n",
        "The function passed to map() and filter() typically takes one argument, while the function passed to reduce() takes two arguments (accumulator and current item).\n",
